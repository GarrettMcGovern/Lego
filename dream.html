       <h2>Dream Buys</h2> 
         <p class="center">The sets in this category are sets that I am never going to buy because of how expensive and large they are. Buying most of these sets would severely cripple my bank account and would be a waste of money.</p>

         <h3>UCS Razor crest</h3>
         <p>This larger version of the Lego Razor crest has over 6000 pieces and is $600. With that many more pieces, the set is going to have more detail than its smaller version, but there is no point buying it because of that and especially because of the price. </p>

         <img src="images/dream/gunship.jpg"  height="200px" alt="Lego Star Wars Ultimate Collectors Edition Republic Gunship"> 
         <h3>UCS Repbulic Gunship</h3>
         <p>This ship is the most iconic ship from the Clone Wars and there currently isn’t a smaller version of this set right now. This set is a little of 3000 pieces coming in at $400 which makes the set not worth the purchase. Out of the sets on here, this is the set that I want the most.  </p>

         <h3>Mos Eisley Cantina</h3> 
         <p>Mos Eisley Cantina is an amazing set. The cantina is a place at the space port in Mos Eisley on the planet Tatooine. This is an important place as this is where Luke and Obi-Wan meet Han Solo and Chewbacca and where we are introduced to the Millennium Falcon for the first time. This set has over 3000 pieces and a whopping 21 minifigures and comes in at $400.  </p>

         <h3>R2-D2</h3>
         <p>This set is a gigantic model of R2-D2 who is one of the most important characters in all of Star Wars. He is in every Star Wars movie and is a crucial part of the entire story. He is my favorite droid as he plays such an important role as it’s said that Star Wars takes place from his POV. This set is over 2000 pieces and $240 making it a set that I am tempted to buy.   </p>

         <h3>UCS Landspeeder</h3> 
         <p>This set is just a bigger version of Luke’s Landspeeder but I think it’s cool because this set has more detail then the smaller version. The set is nearly 2000 pieces and is $240 which in the end is not worth it.   </p>

         <h3>UCS Imperial Star Destroyer</h3>  
         <p>The Lego Star Wars Star Destroyer is the coolest looking command ship in all of Star Wars. Unfortunately, Lego has never made a smaller version of the Star Destroyer. This set is nearly 5000 pieces and is over 3 feet long! The set retailed for about $800 but since it is now retired it goes for over $1k.</p>

         <h3>Death Star</h3> 
         <p>The Death Star is one of the coolest Lego Star Wars sets as it was ever kids dream set. The set is gigantic as it is one big diorama where you can showcase your minifigures into scenes from the movie that all took place in the Death Star. The set is just over 4000 pieces and is over $1000 since it's retired.</p>

         <h3>Eiffel Tower</h3> 
         <p>This replica of the Eiffel Tower is the biggest set that Lego has ever made. The set is 5 feet tall and is 10,000 pieces! The Eiffel Tower is such a cool attraction and something that most people want to see in person. For the amount of pieces, the set is only $630 making the set have good value per piece. </p>
