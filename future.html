       <h2>Future Sets</h2>

         <img src="images/future/at-at.jpg"  height="200px" alt="Lego Star Wars Imperial AT-AT Walker"> 
	     <h3>At-At</h3> 
         <p>This set is cool because the At-At is an iconic Imperial vehicle that causes destruction for the rebels on the planet of Hoth. This vehicle is hard to destroy because of its impenetrable armor which makes it an absolute beast of a vehicle.   </p>

         <img src="images/future/lukehelmet.jpg"  height="200px" alt="Lego Star Wars Luke Skywalker Red Five Helmet"> 
	     <h3>Luke Skywalker Red Five Helmet</h3> 
         <p>This set is Luke’s helmet from when he’s a rebel pilot and it’s a really iconic helmet as all rebel pilots in the Original Trilogy wear that helmet in their battles against the Empire. </p> 
       </section> 
	   <section class="column">
         <img src="images/future/trashcompactor.jpg"  height="200px" alt="Lego Star Wars Death Star Trash Compactor Diaroma"> 
	     <h3>Death Star Trash Compactor</h3> 
         <p>This set is a diorama of the trash compactor scene on the Death Star which is a funny scene from the movie, but also a scene where almost all of the main character die as they are trying to escape the Death Star.  </p>

         <img src="images/future/thechild.jpg"  height="200px"alt="Lego Star Wars Grogu Model"> 
	     <h3>The Child</h3> 
         <p>Grogu is an awesome Star Wars character in the Mandalorian, and this set is a gigantic version of him that looks cool. He is also by far the cutest character in all of Star Wars and is crucial to the Mandalorian show. </p>
       </section> 
	   <section class="column">
         <img src="images/future/tiebomber.jpg"  height="200px" alt="Lego Star Wars Imperial Tie Bomber"> 
	     <h3>Tie Bomber</h3>  
         <p>This set on its own isn’t the best, but matched with the tie fighters it looks nice. This ship was used by the Empire to provide air support by dropping bombs. This ship wasn’t used that often, but when it was, it caused mass destruction.  </p> 
       </section> 
	   <section class="column">
         <img src="images/future/landspeeder.jpg"  height="200px" alt="Lego Star Wars Luke's landspeeder"> 
	     <h3>Luke’s Landspeeder</h3>  
         <p>I’ve always thought that Luke’s land speeder was unique as it’s one of my favorite speeder vehicles and its cool to see how Luke uses this vehicle to get around his home planet of Tatooine.  </p>

         <img src="images/future/captainrex.jpg"  height="200px" alt="Lego Star Wars Captain Rex's Helmet"> 
	     <h3>Captain Rex Helmet</h3>  
         <p>Captain Rex is one of the best characters from the Clone Wars Tv series as he is the commander of the 501st which is Anakin’s legion of clones. The design for his helmet is cool as there is a lot of detail put into the design with the use of color on the visor. </p>
       </section>
	   <section class="column">
         <img src="images/future/cody.jpg"  height="200px" alt="Lego Star Wars Commandor Cody's Helmet"> 
	     <h3>Commander Cody Helmet</h3> 
         <p>Commander Cody is another iconic clone from the Clone Wars Tv series and from the movies. He is the leader of the 212th battalion which fought under Obi-Wan’s command. His helmet isn’t as cool as Rex’s. but nonetheless, it still has a nice and unique design with the visor and the fin.  </p> 
       </section> 
	   <section class="column">
         <img src="images/future/razorcrest.jpg"  height="200px" alt="Lego Star Wars The Razor Crest"> 
	     <h3>Razor Crest</h3>
         <p>The Razor Crest is Mando’s ship in the Mandalorian and it’s unlike any other Star Wars ship that I have ever seen. It’s a bigger and bulkier ship than most ships and it serves its purpose for Mando as he makes his way through the galaxy.  </p>

         <img src="images/future/tuskenraider.jpg"  height="200px" alt="Lego Star Wars Tusken Raider Brick Headz"> 
	     <h3>Tusken Raider</h3> 
         <p>The face of the Tusken Raider looks cool and they are unique creatures that roam the planet of Tatooine and cause havoc towards locals. I like the detail that they were able to put into the Brick Headz sets. </p>
       </section>
	   <section class="column">
         <img src="images/future/ashoka.jpg"  height="200px" alt="Lego Star Wars Ashoka Brick Headz"> 
	     <h3>Ashoka</h3> 
         <p>Ashoka is my favorite female character from Star Wars and one of the best jedi from the Clone Wars and I like her dual blading fighting technique. She is Anakin’s apprentice which is why she is so powerful and the pain she went through in her life is what makes her the character she is.  </p>

	   <section class="column">
         <img src="images/future/vaderobi.jpg"  height="200px" alt="Lego Star Wars Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Brick Headz"> 
	     <h3>Darth Vader and Obi-Wan</h3> 
         <p>The rivalry between Obi-Wan and Darth Vader is something that is iconic in Star Wars. Obi-Wan was Anakin’s master and mentor for over 10 years so when Anakin turned to the dark side and became Darth Vader, they became enemies as Obi-Wan nearly killed him and is what caused him to need the suit to survive.  </p>
