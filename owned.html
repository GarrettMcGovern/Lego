          <h2>Sets Owned</h2>
            <p>Every single set in my Lego collection, except for one, is from the Lego Star Wars collection. In this section I am going to showcase all my sets and include a picture of the set, explain why I like the set and rank the set. The rankings may not be based on the looks alone as I am taking into account how iconic the ship or character is in the movies and Tv shows since the story behind the set can make it cooler Based on what sets I have and where I have them ranked, you can see that the Original Trilogy is my favorite era as I have well over half my sets from that era, and that the Clone Wars era is my least favorite because I have zero of those sets.</p>

         <img src="images/owned/falcon.jpg"  height="200px" alt="Lego Star Wars Millennium Falcon">
           <h3>#1- Millennium Falcon</h3>
           <p>This set is my favorite because it is easily the most iconic ship and recognizable ship from the entire Star Wars universe, and the set is ginormous making it my largest Lego set. </p>

	     <img src="images/owned/vader.jpg"  height="200px" alt="Lego Star Wars Darth Vader Helmet">   
         <h3>#2- Darth Vader Helmet</h3>  
         <p>I like this set because Darth Vader is one of my favorite characters from Star Wars and the helmet is well designed, accurate and bigger than any of the other sets from the helmet collection.  </p>

	     <img src="images/owned/dagobah.jpg"  height="200px" alt="Lego Star Wars Dagobah Jedi Training diorama">   
         <h3>#3- Dagobah Jedi Training</h3> 
         <p>I like this set because the scene of Luke training to become a Jedi is really cool and something that the set replicates well, plus I have always found Yoda’s Hut to be neat. </p>

	     <img src="images/owned/obi-wan.jpg"  height="200px" alt="Lego Star Wars Obi-Wan Starfighter">   
         <h3>#4- Obi-Wan Starfighter</h3> 
         <p>This set is really simplistic, yet the design of Obi-Wan’s ship is very slick and I like how it looks with Obi-Wan in the cockpit and the droid in its own place. </p>

	     <img src="images/owned/slave.jpg"  height="200px" alt="Lego Star Wars Boba Fett's Slave 1">   
         <h3>#5- Slave I</h3> 
         <p>Boba Fett’s Slave I is an iconic ship and well known for being unique, this set has a stand that allows the ship to display as if it were flying, which is a nice touch. </p>

         <h3>#6 Luke’s X-Wing</h3> 
         <p>Luke’s X-Wing is another iconic ship from the Original Trilogy that represents the rebellion as it was the main ship that the Rebels used in their fight against the Empire. </p>

        <h3>#7- Death Star Trench Run</h3>  
        <p>This Diorama show cases a scene from Episode IV of a New Hope at the Battle of Yavin where Luke blows up the death star which is the most important scene in the movie which is what makes the set so cool</p>

	    <img src="images/owned/bobafett.jpg"  height="200px" alt="Lego Star Wars Boba Fett Helmet">   
        <h3>#8- Boba Fett Helmet</h3>
        <p>Boba’s bounty hunting helmet is unique and is another character from Star Wars that is extremely recognizable and well known for his helmet design. I really like the antenna on this set.</p>

	    <img src="images/owned/shuttle.jpg"  height="200px" alt="Lego Star Wars Imperial Shuttle">   
        <h3>#9- Imperial Shuttle</h3> 
        <p>The Imperial shuttle from the Original Trilogy has always been a ship that I liked because of how the wings fold and unfold when taking off and landing. </p>

	    <img src="images/owned/tie.jpg"  height="200px" alt="Lego Star Wars Imperial Tie Fighter">   
        <h3>#10- Tie Fighter</h3>
        <p>The Imperial Tie Fighter is one of the most iconic imperial ship from Star Wars and the design was always something that I admired. </p>

	  <section class="column">
	    <img src="images/owned/naboostarfighter.jpg"  height="200px" alt="Lego Star Wars Mandalorian N-1 Starfighter">   
        <h3>#11- Mandolorian N-1 Starfighter</h3>  
        <p>This ship appears in a couple episodes of the Mandalorian and thought that the design of it was unique as well as the fact that its model is from a Naboo starfighter that’s usually yellow, but is custom made in this instance.   </p>

	    <img src="images/owned/at-st.jpg"  height="200px" alt="Lego Star Wars" alt="Lego Star Wars Imperial At-St Walker">   
        <h3>#12 At-St</h3>
        <p>I have always liked the Imperial At-St walkers as they are unique and typically caused havoc and were hard for the rebels to deal with.  </p>

	    <img src="images/owned/mandohelmet.jpg"  height="200px" alt="Lego Star Wars Mandalorian Helmet">   
        <h3>#13- Mandalorian Helmet</h3> 
        <p>This helmet is really cool because of how sick of a character Mando is but it’s lower down on the list because it’s sort of bland and doesn’t look as good as any of the other helmets in my collection. </p>
	  </section> 
	  <section class="column">
	    <img src="images/owned/mandobrick.jpg"  height="200px" alt="Lego Star Wars Mando & Grogu Brick Headz">   
        <h3>#14 Mando & Grogu Brick Headz</h3>
        <p>I got this set as a gift but overall, I think the simplicity of it makes it look really cool, especially with how much detail they were able to put into Grogu at such a small scale.  </p>

	    <img src="images/owned/michigan.jpg"  height="200px" alt="Model of University of Michigan's Football Staduim; the Big House">   
        <h3>#15- The Big House</h3>
        <p>I ordered this set from an off-brand Lego company which was a pain to build but overall, I like the look of it. I had to get it because I’m a huge U of M fan and I just admire how cool The Big House is as I have been there a couple of times.</p>

	    <img src="images/owned/trooperattack.jpg"  height="200px" alt="Lego Star Wars Death Trooper Attack diorama">   
        <h3>#16- Death Trooper Attack</h3>  
        <p>This set is a scene from the Mandalorian where Luke Skywalker makes a surprise appearance and destroys a bunch of death troopers. I kind of regret buying this set because it’s kind of boring.</p>

	  <section class="column">
	    <img src="images/owned/tatooine.jpg"  height="200px" alt="Lego Star Wars Trouble on Tatooine Set">   
        <h3>#17- Trouble on Tatooine</h3>
        <p>I got this set as a gift. I don’t care much for whatever that gun thing is, but I think the speeder is cool. I personally wouldn’t buy this set, but getting a Lego set for free is something that I can’t complain about. </p>
